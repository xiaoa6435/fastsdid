1. California proposition 99 (`california_prop99.csv`)
This data is from Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller (2010). The raw data is in MATLAB format from https://web.stanford.edu/~jhain/synthpage.html and is preprocessed here to a long panel, and saved as a `;` delimited CSV to work with R's `data()` function.
